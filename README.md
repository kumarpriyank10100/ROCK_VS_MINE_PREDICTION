# 🔍 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

A machine learning project that classifies sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine** using a **Logistic Regression** model. Built with `scikit-learn`, this project walks through the complete ML pipeline — from data loading and EDA to model evaluation and real-world prediction.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Sonar Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)).

It contains 60 features representing sonar signal strengths, and a binary label:

- `0` → Mine  
- `1` → Rock
